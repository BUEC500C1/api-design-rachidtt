# API Design

For all USA Airports, Develop an API and module where we can get current conditions for the airport asked by the API and we can get current weather graphs (for example, the temperature for the last 24 hours) for specific period.  It does not have to be graphs but the data needed.
 -Use CB and CI
 -Develop examples using your API


 Deadline for completion of this project is February 5th, 2020.
